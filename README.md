# Portfolio

## About me

My name is Anastasiia Voropai.
The career path of an automated software tester was interesting to me for quite a long time, so I am excited to improve my existing skills and learn new ones.
I often find bugs on websites and mobile apps that I use. It has always been interesting to me.
In this portfolio, I would like to share my results in the testing field and the technical skills that I have acquired during testing and self-study.

**My experience**

My previous experience ranges from being a business economist to being a self-employed trader.
I do not yet have commercial experience in the field of automated testing, but I really want to get it.
